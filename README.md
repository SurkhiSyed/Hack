# DinoNFT

### Inspiration

Various renowned web3 related games are played across the globe, however many of them lack a functional reward system for the player unlike downloadable multiplayer online games. What if there was a way to change that, a way to create a multi-platform level reward system? A reward system that is able to reliably link the user's account, or wallet, across multiple web3 games? From speaking with various representatives from blockchain companies such as Avalance and Metis, we understood the scope of a web3 player's reality. DinoNFT is the result of an attempt to create a such reward system, where players will be able to leverage from their gameplays and use the rewards from one game for another, whether it be through NFT tokens or in-game items.



This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
